# ComparingViruses
The coronavirus outbreak has affected lives all over the globe. It has led to a global lockdown,
causing massive economic losses to Countries and individuals. The enormous scale of this virus,
and the way it has affected different countries differently is just one piece of the puzzle that is
Covid-19. I believe that the data I am presenting puts the sheer scale of this virus into perspective,
and also dives deeper into how differently the virus has spread as compared to other outbreaks in
the past.

My main task was to compare different metrics for Ebola, H1N1 and Covid-19.
I was able to discover and compare the following for Ebola, H1N1 and Covid-19.
* Number of total cases
* Number of total deaths
* Mortality rate
* Number of infected countries
* Time taken to spread

I also focused more on the Covid-19 dataset, and compared:
* Mortality in countries.
* Cases/Deaths per region.
